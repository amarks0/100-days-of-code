# 100 Days Of Code - Log

### Day 0: March 3, 2021

**Today's Progress**: I wanted to spend some time and dust off my personal editors for this project. Most of my projects outside of work have been within another GUI/application (freeCodeCamp, codepen, etc). So many updates! 

**Thoughts:** What should I focus on for this challenge? I know I am aiming to work on front end frameworks, so let's start there! React/Nextjs, here I come >:)

### Day 1: March 4, 2021 

**Today's Progress**: Decided to focus on Nextjs. I will be rebuilding an app from work and would like to incorporate a frontened framework. At first I thought React but...Next won. I went through their tutorial. I finished the following sections: Creat a Next.js App, Navigate Between Pages, and Assets, Metadata and CSS. 

**Thoughts**: Next.js seems really straightforward. I'm a little excited to work with it more this weekend
