# 100 Days Of Code - Log

### Day 0: March 3, 2021

**Today's Progress**: I wanted to spend some time and dust off my personal editors for this project. Most of my projects outside of work have been within another GUI/application (freeCodeCamp, codepen, etc). So many updates! 

**Thoughts:** What should I focus on for this challenge? I know I am aiming to work on front end frameworks, so let's start there! React/Nextjs, here I come >:)

### Day 1: March 4, 2021 

**Today's Progress**: Decided to focus on Nextjs. I will be rebuilding an app from work and would like to incorporate a frontened framework. At first I thought React but...Next won. I went through their tutorial. I finished the following sections: Creat a Next.js App, Navigate Between Pages, and Assets, Metadata and CSS. 

**Thoughts**: Next.js seems really straightforward. I'm a little excited to work with it more this weekend 

### Day 2: March 5, 2021 

**Today's Progress**: Finished the Nextjs tutorial. Have a cute mini blog that can be used to make a potential side project. 

**Thoughts**: Should I start a side project now or keep trucking along with some tutorials/research...? hm 

### Day 3: March 6, 2021 

**Today's Progress**: Went with some freeCodeCamp courses today. Nextjs is built on top of React, so I thought it would be nice to learn more React through their courses!

**Thoughts**: My eyes are on the front end certificate on freeCodeCamp. Bootstrap/React/Redux, let's gooo

### Day 4: March 7, 2021 

**Today's Progress**: Chugged along with more reach challenges on freeCodeCamp. Currently just over 50% done

**Thoughts**: A little struggle to get started today, but we still made it!
