# 100 Days Of Code - Log

### Day 0: March 3, 2021

**Today's Progress**: I wanted to spend some time and dust off my personal editors for this project. Most of my projects outside of work have been within another GUI/application (freeCodeCamp, codepen, etc). So many updates! 

**Thoughts:** What should I focus on for this challenge? I know I am aiming to work on front end frameworks, so let's start there! React/Nextjs, here I come >:)

### Day 1: March 4, 2021 

**Today's Progress**: Decided to focus on Nextjs. I will be rebuilding an app from work and would like to incorporate a frontened framework. At first I thought React but...Next won. I went through their tutorial. I finished the following sections: Creat a Next.js App, Navigate Between Pages, and Assets, Metadata and CSS. 

**Thoughts**: Next.js seems really straightforward. I'm a little excited to work with it more this weekend 

### Day 2: March 5, 2021 

**Today's Progress**: Finished the Nextjs tutorial. Have a cute mini blog that can be used to make a potential side project. 

**Thoughts**: Should I start a side project now or keep trucking along with some tutorials/research...? hm 

### Day 3: March 6, 2021 

**Today's Progress**: Went with some freeCodeCamp courses today. Nextjs is built on top of React, so I thought it would be nice to learn more React through their courses!

**Thoughts**: My eyes are on the front end certificate on freeCodeCamp. Bootstrap/React/Redux, let's gooo

### Day 4: March 7, 2021 

**Today's Progress**: Chugged along with more reach challenges on freeCodeCamp. Currently just over 50% done

**Thoughts**: A little struggle to get started today, but we still made it! 

### Day 5: March 8, 2021 

**Today's Progress**: Started building a simple web app using nextjs and tailwindcss. I'm thinking I may build on this as the challenge goes on. So far I am working on building an interactive/responsive side navigation bar. 

**Thoughts**: Will I ever get out of tutorial hell? -_-

### Day 6: March 9, 2021 

**Today's Progress**: Honestly didn't do much on this day. I worked on some work projects that I am gonna cheat and say was part of this (jk, I know its not)

**Thoughts**: Strugglin! 

### Day 7: March 8, 2021 

**Today's Progress**: I did some freeCodeCamp React challenges. It was a little hard to focus so I only went through a few :/ 

**Thoughts**: Still strugglin

### Day 8: March 9, 2021 

**Today's Progress**: 

**Thoughts**: I'm filling this out on the 15th, so yea, still struggling on keeping up with logs but I am still coding! 

### Day 9: March 10, 2021 

**Today's Progress**: freeCodeCamp? nextjs? CSS? 

**Thoughts**: I definitely don't remember the rest of these logs up until the ~12th FAIL

### Day 10: March 11, 2021 

**Today's Progress**: See Day 9

**Thoughts**: See Day 9

### Day 11: March 12, 2021 

**Today's Progress**: updating my simple nextjs web app. I mistakenly tried to follow a random navigation bar tutorial that DIDN'T WORK. Tried to figure out the problem as to why it wasn't loading my button/bar components annnd didn't figure it out before taking a break. 

**Thoughts**: I need to step away from implementing things that I find in tutorials and just bite the bullet to create by myself. It's okay to look for tips and inspiration, but girl. We need to get out tutorial hell 

### Day 12: March 13, 2021 

**Today's Progress**: Lightbulb with that navigation bar. Which was just to remove all the junk I added from the tutorial. I just went back to the basics and nothing fancy. Just a NavBar component with pages and buttons. No button components like the tutorial had

**Thoughts**: I need to learn how to not want 139151 things done at project start up. Writing small goals is something I need to work on. That should help? 

### Day 13: March 14, 2021 

**Today's Progress**: Updating my simple web app. Learning how to add styles to components and structuring the file system with CSS files. I'm thinking I might have to do more deep dives into React since Nextjs is built on top of that. I also watched a portion of the newer version of Nextjs crash course by Traversy which was nice. 

**Thoughts**: I should get back to freeCodeCamp with React! 

### Day 14: March 15, 2021 

**Today's Progress**: Gonna be one hunnid, I am posting this before I complete this day. BUT. I will finish at least one React challenge on freeCodeCamp. 

**Thoughts**: Sheesh, I need to keep up to date with these logs and twitter haha. Backfilling 4-5 days is not the bizness

### Day 15: March 16, 2021 

**Today's Progress**: Here I go backfilling these logs again. Fail~. And ngl, totally did not complete the next react challenges on freeCodeCamp like I thought I would on the previous day. And I continued to not do any coding outside of work for the next 2 days. I'm in a slump!! 

**Thoughts**: I guess I'm not completly off the 100 day train.. keeping up with these logs at least let me remind myself that I need to keep pushing. Almost at the 20% mark...

### Day 16: March 17, 2021 

**Today's Progress**: Sat with the React challenge menu up again. Still didn't do much coding outside of work... 

**Thoughts**: I may need to return to tutorial hell to get more direction. I purchased a class on Udemy that will at least help me in terms of structure for this challenge. I plan to start this weekend, which is the 20-21  

### Day 17: March 18, 2021 

**Today's Progress**: Nothing done related to this challenge. 

**Thoughts**: -_____________-

### Day 18: March 19, 2021 

**Today's Progress**: What a moody day. I had today off and sat down to start some coding several times but was distracted... Some self care was in order and from then on nothing really happened. Except now, where I am backfilling the last few days of non-activity. 

**Thoughts**: Again, stared at the SAME REACT CHALLENGE. Haha...ha

### Day 19: March 20, 2021 

**Today's Progress**: Started a react bootcamp course from Udemy like I mentioned on a previous day. I figured that I need more back knowledge of React to get a full understanding. Got a good chunk done today. 

**Thoughts**: Althought I've used React before, I think its good to go back to basics since I've always just jumped in first. 

### Day 20: March 21, 2021 

**Today's Progress**: Continued the react bootcamp class. The first bits are more like a review more than anything. Getting that foundation set still. 

**Thoughts**: Maybe had less than an hour session today :/ 

### Day 21: March 22, 2021 

**Today's Progress**: I was pretty beat after the gym. I sat in front of freeCodeCamp and tried to get my mind right and my fingers moving. Nope. I'll make up the time tomorrow. 

**Thoughts**: Meeeh. 

### Day 22: March 23, 2021 

**Today's Progress**: Finished another section in the react bootcamp course. Made a cute little pokemon game. Then did some react challenges on freeCodeCamp. Made up the hour from yesterday! 

**Thoughts**: I'm glad I went with a course for structure. I'll definitely be done before the 100 days, but will help in later projects. Also found out about 50reactprojects.com. Inspiration for later? 


### Day 23: March 24, 2021 

**Today's Progress**: Started the a longer section of the course I'm working on that deals with React state. I really like freeCodeCamp, but sometimes it jumps up in terms on knowledge after each challenege and state introduction kinda got me confused. So this was nice. 

**Thoughts**: Almost 25% done!

### Day 24: March 25, 2021 

**Today's Progress**: I was planning on working on some freeCodeCamp but it became an emotional day where we almost lost a family pet. SO. didn't make any progress today, but I will make up for it tomorrow. 

**Thoughts**: It really is something where emotions can knock whatever motivation you have in a whole 'nother direction...

### Day 25: March 26, 2021 

**Today's Progress**: Family pet okay. :) Did freeCodeCamp for an hour and then off and on inbetween DBD matches (load times are loooong)

**Thoughts**: 25% done! We in here! 


### Day 26: March 26, 2021 

**Today's Progress**: Tbh, did not get a full hour in today, but did complete some more freeCodeCamp challenges. 

**Thoughts**: I didn't do any of the bootcamp class first because I need to code out an exercise first... 


### Day 27: March 28, 2021 

**Today's Progress**: Completed a state section in the react bootcamp I'm in. It included building a simple app that had a button that generated a random number. If the number was a certain value, the button disappeared and other content took its place. 

**Thoughts**: Proud of myself for actually doing this exercise without watching or coding along with the solution first. It's easy to say "Oh yea, thats simple. You just gotta do x then y..." and then just look at the solution without actually coding out the complete solution first. Gotta work those brain muscles first ;)


### Day 27: March 29, 2021 

**Today's Progress**: Not much besides work programming.. 

**Thoughts**: -_-



### Day 28: March 30, 2021 

**Today's Progress**: Not much besides work programming.. tired after teaching tabata and eas extra laxy. 

**Thoughts**: Gotta continue on the react course soon. I would love to finally complete a Udemy class, ha! 



### Day 29: March 31, 2021 

**Today's Progress**: Not much besides work programming..

**Thoughts**: -____-



### Day 30: April 1, 2021 

**Today's Progress**: Not much besides work programming..

**Thoughts**: -__-


### Day 31: April 2, 2021 

**Today's Progress**: Started the Roll Dice exercise on the react bootcamp. Deciding on whether or not I want to code along.. but I did build the project and made my core component structure. Did some research as well on font awesome, since this exercise uses the CDN for FA 4... only to find out the CDN does not work anymore and that I'll have to use the react-fontawesome package install instead. Hurraaayy

**Thoughts**: I was really trying to make the fontawesome thing work, but nah son. you ain't getting my email JUST so I can get the newest CDN link. pfft


### Day 31: April 3, 2021 

**Today's Progress**: 

**Thoughts**: TRying to retro fit new tech to older versions of module packages is frustrating, but it definitely helps me learn more. Can't just copy and paste -- gottta put in a little extra time to find the newer versions of commands and such



### Day 31: April 4, 2021 

**Today's Progress**: Continued to try to match react fontawesome to the react bootcamp class that I am taking. All done with the dice exercise besides the animation. The CSS animation was not the main idea for the exercise, so I am okay with moving on for now

**Thoughts**: This reminds me of soime CSS challenges I wanted to do. What was it called...? 30 days of CSS? CSS Pie? Worth looking up later! 


### Day 32: April 5, 2021 

**Today's Progress**: Worked on some freeCodeCamp react challenges -- currently just less that 90% done. I also thnk I may want to start doing side applications as well. Since I was playing DBD and doing challenges in between, I think I will do a random character generator with basic perks. i think that should be fun!

**Thoughts**: Almost 1/3 of the way done with the challenge :) 


### Day 33: April 6, 2021 

**Today's Progress**: For today, I did not do much outside of work with coding or programming. 

**Thoughts**: 33% done with the challenge!

### Day 34: April 7, 2021 

**Today's Progress**: Played DbD while doing freeCodeCamp challenges inbetween matches. The long queue times finally have a purpose, haha. 

**Thoughts**: I am backilling on April 9, so I'm not sure what day I did this, but I am done with the React portion on freeCodeCamp! On to redux!

### Day 35: April 8, 2021 

**Today's Progress**: Completed a section in the react bootcamp course. This one was about more state exercises with a dice roll example. I also started the next one which had examples with lottery balls. 

**Thoughts**: Also did these videos/exercises between DbD matches, haha. I've found a system!! 

### Day 36: April 9, 2021 

**Today's Progress**: A little more work with the react course during Dbd matches~. I finished the lottery ball exercise and moved on to the next section which featured some more state exercises. 

**Thoughts**: Finally Friday~
