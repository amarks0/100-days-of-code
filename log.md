# 100 Days Of Code - Log

### Day 0: March 3, 2021

**Today's Progress**: I wanted to spend some time and dust off my personal editors for this project. Most of my projects outside of work have been within another GUI/application (freeCodeCamp, codepen, etc). So many updates! 

**Thoughts:** What should I focus on for this challenge? I know I am aiming to work on front end frameworks, so let's start there! React/Nextjs, here I come >:)

### Day 1: March 4, 2021 

**Today's Progress**: Decided to focus on Nextjs. I will be rebuilding an app from work and would like to incorporate a frontened framework. At first I thought React but...Next won. I went through their tutorial. I finished the following sections: Creat a Next.js App, Navigate Between Pages, and Assets, Metadata and CSS. 

**Thoughts**: Next.js seems really straightforward. I'm a little excited to work with it more this weekend 

### Day 2: March 5, 2021 

**Today's Progress**: Finished the Nextjs tutorial. Have a cute mini blog that can be used to make a potential side project. 

**Thoughts**: Should I start a side project now or keep trucking along with some tutorials/research...? hm 

### Day 3: March 6, 2021 

**Today's Progress**: Went with some freeCodeCamp courses today. Nextjs is built on top of React, so I thought it would be nice to learn more React through their courses!

**Thoughts**: My eyes are on the front end certificate on freeCodeCamp. Bootstrap/React/Redux, let's gooo

### Day 4: March 7, 2021 

**Today's Progress**: Chugged along with more reach challenges on freeCodeCamp. Currently just over 50% done

**Thoughts**: A little struggle to get started today, but we still made it! 

### Day 5: March 8, 2021 

**Today's Progress**: Started building a simple web app using nextjs and tailwindcss. I'm thinking I may build on this as the challenge goes on. So far I am working on building an interactive/responsive side navigation bar. 

**Thoughts**: Will I ever get out of tutorial hell? -_-

### Day 6: March 9, 2021 

**Today's Progress**: Honestly didn't do much on this day. I worked on some work projects that I am gonna cheat and say was part of this (jk, I know its not)

**Thoughts**: Strugglin! 

### Day 7: March 8, 2021 

**Today's Progress**: I did some freeCodeCamp React challenges. It was a little hard to focus so I only went through a few :/ 

**Thoughts**: Still strugglin

### Day 8: March 9, 2021 

**Today's Progress**: 

**Thoughts**: I'm filling this out on the 15th, so yea, still struggling on keeping up with logs but I am still coding! 

### Day 9: March 10, 2021 

**Today's Progress**: freeCodeCamp? nextjs? CSS? 

**Thoughts**: I definitely don't remember the rest of these logs up until the ~12th FAIL

### Day 10: March 11, 2021 

**Today's Progress**: See Day 9

**Thoughts**: See Day 9

### Day 11: March 12, 2021 

**Today's Progress**: updating my simple nextjs web app. I mistakenly tried to follow a random navigation bar tutorial that DIDN'T WORK. Tried to figure out the problem as to why it wasn't loading my button/bar components annnd didn't figure it out before taking a break. 

**Thoughts**: I need to step away from implementing things that I find in tutorials and just bite the bullet to create by myself. It's okay to look for tips and inspiration, but girl. We need to get out tutorial hell 

### Day 12: March 13, 2021 

**Today's Progress**: Lightbulb with that navigation bar. Which was just to remove all the junk I added from the tutorial. I just went back to the basics and nothing fancy. Just a NavBar component with pages and buttons. No button components like the tutorial had

**Thoughts**: I need to learn how to not want 139151 things done at project start up. Writing small goals is something I need to work on. That should help? 

### Day 13: March 14, 2021 

**Today's Progress**: Updating my simple web app. Learning how to add styles to components and structuring the file system with CSS files. I'm thinking I might have to do more deep dives into React since Nextjs is built on top of that. I also watched a portion of the newer version of Nextjs crash course by Traversy which was nice. 

**Thoughts**: I should get back to freeCodeCamp with React! 

### Day 14: March 15, 2021 

**Today's Progress**: Gonna be one hunnid, I am posting this before I complete this day. BUT. I will finish at least one React challenge on freeCodeCamp. 

**Thoughts**: Sheesh, I need to keep up to date with these logs and twitter haha. Backfilling 4-5 days is not the bizness
